# Bouncing Ballz

## Information

For the project has been used a custom small framework for adaptive webpages.

### How to play
- Tap the screen to generate a ball.
- Hold on the screen, drag, and release a little further to give the ball initial force.
- The ball will change color based on its speed.
- When balls collide, an impulse is created, and they become the same color.
- Optimization allows for the creation of at least 50 simultaneous balls.
